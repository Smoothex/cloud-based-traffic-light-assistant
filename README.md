# Welcome to our Cloud-based traffic light assistant app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

# Prerequisites
- npm version: ~10.8.1
- Node.js version: ~21.7.3

# Changes in libraries
1. react-native-google-places-autocomplete
   - Go to node_modules and find the library
   - In GooglePlacesAutocomplete.js go to line 866 and add the following code:
   ```
   if (stateText?.length > 0) {
      _handleChangeText(stateText);
   }
   ```
   - This allows for results to be queried when text is input by voice

## How to build the app using EAS CLI

1. In the terminal install eas-cli using `npm install -g eas-cli`
2. Create an account for [Expo Dev](expo.dev)
3. Log in with your credentials using `eas login`
4. Configure your project using `eas build:configure`, which creates an 
`eas.json` file with configs
5. Either build the `android` folder locally with  `npx expo prebuild` or skip this step because it happens automatically in the pipeline
6. Add the environmental variables from your `.env` file in Secrets of your Expo project on the Expo dev page in order to build the app correctly
7. Start a building pipeline with `eas build -p android --profile development`
8. After the pipeline succeeds you can download the <em>.apk</em> on your file via the link from your terminal or you can find it in Builds on the Expo dev page
9. After installing the app on your physical device you have to start a server with `npx expo start`

## How to run the app using Expo Go

1. Install Expo Go on your physical device

2. Install dependencies
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a .env folder where to place some non-public data like the Google API key in our case

4. Start the app and follow the instructions from the terminal
   ```
    npx expo start
   ```
